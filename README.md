# Hangman
Last night I dreamt that i was a car. I woke up feeling exhausted... Hi i'm mike! Welcome to hangman, the wildest and craziest game around!

The file playhangman.bash is a shell script to run a game of hangman

The game probably wont change your life but i hope it brings some small spark of amusement and reminds you of the old, glitchy days of gaming... good times! 



## To run:
from inside the hangman folder in a bash shell run the following command
$sh playhangman.bash


## How to play:
- You can either play with a randomly generated word that comes from the file words.txt (feel free to add words to the file) or make your own word!
- You get 9 guesses. If you run out a man dies... no pressure
- Guess one letter at a time to eventually find the hidden word!

#### Always Remember: Family, Religion, Friendship.... These are the three demons you must slay if you want to succeed in hangman. Good luck!
